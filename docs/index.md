# What is the Landscape Habitat Output Extension?

The Landscape Habitat Output extension is designed to estimate a quantity of suitability or abundance for multiple species, using environmental variables that can be provided internally by LANDIS-II.  Variables can include climate (through the climate library or externally provided), aboveground biomass, forest type, or land cover, at various spatial scales.

This extension is differentiated from the [Local Habitat Suitability Output](https://landis-ii-foundation.github.io/Extension-Local-Habitat-Suitability-Output/) extension in that this extension incorporates neighborhood variables and distance variables which take into consideration the landscape context of a site, and not just local site attributes.  The Local Habitat Suitability Output extension does provide the ability to use local disturbance history in the determination of habitat suitability, which this extension does not.
